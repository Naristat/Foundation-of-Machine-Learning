  <h1>Lecture 17: Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>
    Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to
    learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  
  </p>

  <h2>1. What is Machine Learning?</h2>
  <p>
    Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that improve automatically through experience.  
    Instead of relying on hard-coded instructions, ML systems identify patterns, adapt to new inputs, and improve their performance over time.  
  </p>
  <div class="example">
    <b>Example:</b> A spam email filter learns to classify emails as “spam” or “not spam” by analyzing thousands of labeled emails.
  </div>

  <h2>2. Types of Machine Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Supervised Learning:</b> Models learn from labeled data (input → output).</li>
    <li><b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> Models discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
    <li><b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> An agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <b>Example:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>Supervised: Predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.</li>
      <li>Unsupervised: Grouping customers into clusters for marketing.</li>
      <li>Reinforcement: A robot learning to walk by trial and error.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Hypothesis Space & Inductive Bias</h2>
  <p>
    The <b>hypothesis space</b> is the set of all possible models a learning algorithm can choose from.  
    <b>Inductive bias</b> is the set of assumptions a model makes to predict unseen data.  
  </p>
  <div class="example">
    <b>Example:</b> Linear regression assumes the relationship between variables is linear.
  </div>

  <h2>4. Model Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    To assess how well a model performs, we use evaluation techniques such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Accuracy:</b> Correct predictions ÷ Total predictions.</li>
    <li><b>Cross-validation:</b> Splitting data into multiple folds to ensure model generalization.</li>
    <li><b>Precision, Recall, F1-score:</b> Metrics for classification problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <b>Example:</b> In medical diagnosis, high recall ensures that fewer sick patients are missed.
  </div>

  <h2>5. Real-Life Applications of ML</h2>
  <div class="application">
    <b>Healthcare:</b> Predicting disease risks from patient data, medical image analysis.
  </div>
  <div class="application">
    <b>Finance:</b> Fraud detection in credit card transactions, stock market prediction.
  </div>
  <div class="application">
    <b>E-commerce:</b> Personalized product recommendations (Amazon, Netflix, Spotify).
  </div>
  <div class="application">
    <b>Transportation:</b> Self-driving cars using reinforcement learning and computer vision.
  </div>
  <div class="application">
    <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> Voice assistants like Alexa, Google Translate.
  </div>

  <h2>6. Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Machine Learning is transforming industries by enabling data-driven decision-making.  
    It covers different paradigms—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—each applied to real-world problems.  
    In the next lectures, we will dive into specific algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, Bayesian learning, and support vector machines.
